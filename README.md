# libgdx3D-Bullet-Experiments

A bunch of experimentations and tests i made with the bullet physics library, if you're interested in stuff like simulating explosions, black hole simulations and a bunch of other stuff, you can use this as learning material.
Note however that the mixamo animation test doesn't work, I'll work on it later (once I learn to use blender).
